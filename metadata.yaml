description: Harry Clavering, after a brilliant career at Oxford, was jilted by Julia
  Brabazon in favor of a wealthy old debauchee, Lord Ongar. After an unhappy year
  on the Continent, culminating in the death of her husband, the wealthy widow, accompanied
  by the sycophant Sophie Gordeloup and her brother Count Pateroff, established herself
  in London. Harry had become a civil engineer and was engaged to Florence Burton,
  daughter of a member of his firm. Assuming incorrectly that Lady Ongar knew of his
  engagement, he allowed himself to be again drawn into her circle until it became
  clear that she wished to renew their old engagement. The temptation was great but
  he resisted it. About this time Sir Hugh Clavering and his brother were drowned
  in a storm off the coast of Norway and Harry became the heir to the estate and married
  Florence.
